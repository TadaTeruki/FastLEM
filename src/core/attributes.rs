/// Attributes of sites.
/// The shape of terrain will be determined by these attributes.
/// I refer https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-9-1239-2021 to define these attributes. See the paper how these attributes affect the shape of terrain.
/// ### Attributes
///  - `uplift_rate` is the uplift rate (unit: L/T).
///  - `erodibility` is the erodibility.
///  - `base_altitude` is the base altitude (unit: L). If the base altitude is set to 0, the lowest altitude will be 0.
///  - `max_slope` is the maximum slope (unit: rad). This value must be in the range of [0, Ï€/2).
///     If you don't want to set the maximum slope, set `None`.
