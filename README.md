**fastlem** [/ˈfæstlɛm/] is a rust library that provides methods for simulating landscape evolution processes to create realistic terrain data with plausible relief.

The **[fastlem web simulator](https://fastlem.peruki.dev/)** is available to try out manually creating virtual terrain with fastlem.

## About the simulation

fastlem follows the Salève model[1], which provides an analytical solution to landscape evolution with SPIM (Stream Power Incision Model) in 2D. The algorithm for creating the drainage network follows the method of Guillaume Cordonnier, Jean Braun, Marie-Paule Cani, Bedrich Benes, Eric Galin, et al[2].

### Build a graph

Terrain data is represented as a planar graph. This graph structure is used to compute all topographic simulations for terrain generation.

For fastlem with 2D model, `TerrainModel2DBulider` is required to construct the graph from given sites as `TerrainModel2D` by computing a Delaunay triangulation. You can optionally use `relaxate_sites` to move the sites to approximately equal positions using Lloyd's algorithm.

```rust
let model = TerrainModel2DBulider::from_random_sites(num, bound_min, bound_max) // generate sites randomly
    .relaxate_sites(1) // relaxate sites using Lloyd's algorithm
    .unwrap()
    .build() // build
    .unwrap();
```

### Create terrain generator

Before starting terrain generation, `TerrainGenerator` is required to use the planer graph and assign the topographic parameters to each site.

```rust 
let terrain_generator = TerrainGenerator::default()
    .set_model(model)
    .set_parameters(
        (0..num)
            .map(|_| TopographicalParameters::default().set_erodibility(1.0))
            .collect::<_>(),
    );
```

 - **is_outlet** is whether the site can be an outlet (including oceans) or not. If `is_outlet`, the elevation is always set to 0.0.
 - **erodibility** is the erodibility of the site. This is the main parameter that determines the shape of the terrain.

### Generate terrain

```rust
let terrain = terrain_generator.generate().unwrap();
```

Terrains are generated by calling `TerrainGenerator::generate()`.

### Get altitudes

In general you can get the sites and altitudes as vectors by calling `[Terrain]::sites()` and `[Terrain]::altitudes()`.

The indices of each vector correspond to each other.

```rust
let sites = terrain.sites();
let altitudes = terrain.altitudes();
// print
for i in 0..sites.len() {
    println!(
        "Site: ({}, {}), Altitude: {}",
        sites[i].x, sites[i].y, altitudes[i]
    );
}
```

You can also query the altitude of a specific site in the 2D surface model by calling `Terrain2D::get_altitude(Site2D)`.

```rust
let site = Site2D { x, y };
let altitude = terrain.get_altitude(&site);
```

Note that this method uses natural neighbour interpolation (with the [naturalneighbor](https://crates.io/crates/naturalneighbor) package) to interpolate the specific altitude between sites and takes approximately O(logN).

Below is an example of using `get_altitude` to create an image of the generated terrain:

```rust
let img_width = 500;
let img_height = 500;

let mut image_buf = image::RgbImage::new(img_width, img_height);
// calculate the max altitude
let max_altitude = terrain
    .altitudes()
    .iter()
    .fold(std::f64::MIN, |acc, &n| n.max(acc));

for imgx in 0..img_width {
    for imgy in 0..img_height {
        let x = bound_max.x * (imgx as f64 / img_width as f64);
        let y = bound_max.y * (imgy as f64 / img_height as f64);
        let site = Site2D { x, y };
        let altitude = terrain.get_altitude(&site);
        if let Some(altitude) = altitude {
            let color = ((altitude / max_altitude) * 255.0) as u8;
            // put grayscale pixel
            image_buf.put_pixel(imgx as u32, imgy as u32, image::Rgb([color, color, color]));
        }
    }
}

image_buf.save("image.png").unwrap();
```
